#A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
# In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict["model"]

#Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict.get("model")

#Change the "year" to 2018:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

#Loop Through a Dictionary
thisdict["year"] = 2018
print(x)

#Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:

for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

#You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:

for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

#Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

#Check if Key Exists
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

#Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))

#Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

#Removing Items
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

#The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

#The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
#print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

#The clear() method empties the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:

myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

#want to nest three dictionaries that already exists as dictionaries:
#Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:

child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}

myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}

#The dict() Constructor
#It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a new dictionary:

thisdict = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
print(thisdict)

# Dictionary Methods
# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.
#
# Method	Description
# clear()	Removes all the elements from the dictionary
# copy()	Returns a copy of the dictionary
# fromkeys()	Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value
# get()	Returns the value of the specified key
# items()	Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
# keys()	Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
# pop()	Removes the element with the specified key
# popitem()	Removes the last inserted key-value pair
# setdefault()	Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value
# update()	Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs
# values()	Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
